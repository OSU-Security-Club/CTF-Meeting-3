<h2>Binary Exploit Challenge</h2>

<p>
    In this challenge, you will attempt to "exploit" a binary executable.
    For the purposes of this challenge, this just means getting the binary to
    print out "Success". This is done by passing the correct command line argument
    to the binary. The binary is compiled with no debug symbols, so this makes your
    life a bit more challenging. This challenge is designed to be solved using GBD
    alone.
</p>
<p>
    You can download the binary <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='mystery') }}">here.</a>
    It was compiled on flip, so you will be able to run it there.
</p>

<h5>Potentially Useful GDB commands</h5>

<p>
    Invoke GDB on executable:
    <pre>
        $ gdb &lt;execuable&gt;
    </pre>

    Set command line args to pass to executable:
    <pre>
        (gdb) set args &lt;args there can be spaces here no need to quote&gt;
    </pre>

    Start running the program:
    <pre>
        (gdb) run
    </pre>

    Continue running program after breakpoint:
    <pre>
        (gdb) c
    </pre>

    Step forward one line of code:
    <pre>
        (gdb) s
    </pre>

    Step forward one assembly instruction:
    <pre>
        (gdb) si
    </pre>

    Set breakpoint on function by name:
    <pre>
        (gdb) b &lt;function_name&gt;
    </pre>

    Show breakpoints:
    <pre>
        (gdb) info breakpoints
    </pre>

    Show register values:
    <pre>
        (gdb) info registers
    </pre>

    Show value at memory address:
    <pre>
        (gdb) x 0x1234
    </pre>

    Show value at memory address as a string:
    <pre>
        (gdb) x/s 0x1234
    </pre>

    Show assembly code for current function:
    <pre>
        (gdb) disassemble
    </pre>
</p>
