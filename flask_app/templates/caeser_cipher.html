<h2>Caeser Cipher Challenge</h2>

<p>
    In his <i> Life of Julius Caeser </i> the Roman historian Suetonius writes:
    "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by
    so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could
    be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning,
    he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and
    so with the others." This is the first recorded use of this encryption
    scheme, in which characters are shifted by an agreed upon number of
    positions and is called the "Caeser Cipher" after its most famous user.
